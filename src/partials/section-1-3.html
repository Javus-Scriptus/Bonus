                <p>Selling your home doesn't have to mean giving up its future worth. Bonus™ <br> lets you sell your
                    current equity, move out and still keep ownership in your <br> home. With no showings, no
                    closing costs and lower fees than a traditional <br> sale, Bonus™ is a faster, easier and
                    smarter way to sell, all while keeping <br> your home as a long-term investment!</p>
